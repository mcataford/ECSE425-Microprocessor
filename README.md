# Instructions

__All pipeline design files are in the CPUImplementation/ directory.__

__To run, include the relevant files, and the CPU_tb.vhd testbench present in the Testbench/ subdirectory.__

## A. Basic pipeline

To run the pipeline, include the files present in _unoptimized/_ as well as the CPU_tb.vhd testbench present in _testbenches/_.

## B. Caches

The attempt as integrating the 2-way associative cache can be found in _associativeCached/_. It uses the same testbench as the regular pipeline.

## C. Other cache designs

The cache designs are in the _caches/_ directory and need to be included with the _associativeCached/_ contents.
